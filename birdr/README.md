To begin with I want to apologize for the general structure of this program.

This program allows users to create a journal that stores instances of bird sightings. (create)

As a user you can check information about birds that have been seen by all users, and more info about your favorite bird (read)

The "Admin" user has the power to delete individual users, birds, and whole lists of birds and users. (destroy)

As Admin you can update a bird or user to correct information that has been entered incorrectly. (update)
